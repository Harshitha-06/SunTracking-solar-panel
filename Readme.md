## 📌 Introduction
This project focuses on designing and implementing a sun-tracking solar panel system using Arduino. The system improves solar energy efficiency by adjusting the panel's position to follow the sun's movement throughout the day.

## ✨ Features
✅ Automatic tracking of the sun using light sensors (LDRs)
✅ Dual-axis movement for maximum efficiency
✅ Real-time adjustment using servo motors
✅ Energy-efficient design
✅ Easy integration with solar power systems

## 🔧 Components Required
- Arduino Uno
- Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs)
- Servo Motors (2x)
- Solar Panel
- Motor Driver Module
- Power Supply
- Resistors & Connecting Wires

## ⚙️ Working Principle
1. LDR sensors detect the sunlight intensity in different directions.
2. Arduino processes the sensor data to determine the sun's position.
3. The servo motors adjust the panel to maximize sunlight exposure.
4. The system continuously tracks the sun throughout the day.
